1) There are several cubes on the stage. When you click on a cube, it disappears and new cubes appear, in a random amount from 2 to 6 pieces.
For each new cube, the Scale is reduced by half along all axes.
The color of each cube is determined randomly.
Each cube is subject to the force of gravity.
The chance of separation decreases by 2 times each time starting from 100%. If successful, the division occurs, otherwise the cube simply disappears.
Add an explosive force from the center of the vanished cube, which will scatter only the objects it created.
Make invisible fences to prevent the cubes from flying far away.

2) I implement an explosion if new cubes are not created. When you click on a cube, it explodes and disappears,
pushing other cubes in different directions. Explosion, affects a certain area.
The further the object is from the center of the explosion, the less force will be applied to the object.
The smaller the cube, the greater the radius and the force with which it scatters other cubes.
